Behave *requires* a /steps directory from which to load the steps.

cyber-dojo does not currently support subdirectories as part of the
language/test/exercise setup.

To get around that, the cyber-dojo.sh file which runs the contents of
your project creates a temporary /steps folder and copies *_steps.py
to it before running behave, then removes the folder and its contents.

IMPORTANT: If you add a new steps file, be sure to name it *_steps.py
so that it will be copied into the temporary steps directory and
available to your project.
