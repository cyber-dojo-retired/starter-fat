# Upgrading? Multiple language versions?

# It's common to want to add a new test-framework to
# an existing language and, when doing this, to take
# advantage of upgrading the language to a newer version.
#
# For example
#    Ruby1.9.3/Approval
#    Ruby1.9.3/Cucumber
#    Ruby1.9.3/Rspec
#    Ruby1.9.3/TestUnit
# existed when I wanted to add MiniTest as a new Ruby test-framework.
# By then the latest Ruby version was 2.1.3
#    Ruby2.1.3/MiniTest
#
# I didn't want to have to upgrade the existing Ruby1.9.3 test-frameworks
# to Ruby2.1.3. But... on the setup page I wanted all the different
# Ruby test-frameworks (from two different versions of Ruby) to appear
# under the *same* language name in the left column.
# This is why a language/test's  manifest.json file has a display_name entry.
# It is the display_name that governs the language/test's names as they appear
# on the setup page. Not the folder name. Not the docker image_name.
#
# The display_name should have been used *only* for the setup page.
# However, I also stored it in the kata's manifest and used it to look up
# the language (now start_point) to get the image_name when forking.
# That was a mistake. The kata's manifest now stores the image_name directly.
